# Learn Next.js Fullstack using Google-Gemini 🚀

This project is a practical exploration of **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, demonstrating how to build a modern full-stack application with server-side logic and database integration.

It serves as a proof-of-concept for handling data mutations directly from the frontend using the latest React Server Actions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Server Actions:** Handles form submissions (POST) and deletions (DELETE) directly on the server without creating separate API endpoints.
- **Database Integration:** Uses **Prisma ORM** with **SQLite** to store guestbook messages permanently.
- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, and Delete messages securely.
- **Hybrid Rendering:** A seamless mix of Server Components (for performance/SEO) and Client Components (for interactivity like the "Like" button).
- **Optimized UX:** Includes real-time loading states (`useFormStatus`) and input validation.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Blog system implementation using dynamic slugs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** JavaScript / React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** SQLite via Prisma ORM
